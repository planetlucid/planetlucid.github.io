For my React Final Project, I sought out to create a React web app where users can create detailed notes about song structure and musical data such as scale, mode, bpm, . This is a song-writer’s companion to focus on setting boundaries so as a musician, you can break rules and push the boundaries. Users can add their own songs (streaming from Soundcloud) or simply take note of some of their favorites songs as a way to gain insight from ‘studying the greats’.

The problem this solves is that the data for songs exists on multiple platforms. Right now to look at all this data, I'd have to look at upwards of 5 sites and use a custom app to analyze the song for key, bpm, and mode.

If this app is successful, users will eventually come here for all important song data regarding the secret sauce of making hit records.


**Overall, here is the User Journey:**

    - Users can manually add song data from an artist, or search an API to add a song. 
    - Song Data - 
        - Structure - Verse, Chorus, Pre-Chorus, Bridge, Resolution, etc
        - Song length, title, and artist name
        - Key/Scale, Mode(‘Dorian’ vs ‘Pentatonic’, BPM, Genre, Streams, Sales 
        - Other than name of Artist and Song Title other items can come from a dropdown 
        - Song data can possibly come from API
        - possible ability to sort by scale,
        - Full Crud

When I got the basic functionality listed, I then switched over to front-end. I think that when building apps it's important to focus on the problem that's being solved. Therefore my inital focus was on function before form. However both are very important.


**Here is what i listed:**
- - Layout options
  - Split Screen
    - Stacked Rows - 
    - Vertical Columns - Bookshelf
       
			 
**In the future, I plan on extending this web app to have: **

    - User accounts
    - Share (turns song item into jpeg to be shared)
    - Liner Notes
    - Instrumentation - Horns
        - Per Section
